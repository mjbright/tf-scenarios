# About this config

It is known to work with AWS, Azure & Proxmox providing you set credentials appropriately
- I use env variables for AWS and Proxmox
- I use az login, which create ~/.azure for Azure

Not tested with Docker, but should be doable ...

# LFD459-student.zip file

This file - not included - contains files for a student user for my Kubernetes trainings

# files, http folders

These folders are for cloud-init use by Proxmox - they are not used by other configs

# TEST/* folders

These folders contain terraform configs to fire up a test vm and connect by ssh
