# We can set actual values for variables in
# the following files which will be read automatically:
# - terraform.tfvars
# - *.auto.tfvars
#
# or other variable files which we specify on the command-line

# Note: variables must have already been defined in by a variable block
#       typically in a file called vars.tf
