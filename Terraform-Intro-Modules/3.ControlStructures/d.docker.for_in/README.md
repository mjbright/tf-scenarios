- Transformations from List to List, with or without filtering
- Transformations from Map  to List, with or without filtering
- Transformations from List to Map , with or without filtering
- Transformations from Map  to Map , with or without filtering
- A more practical example for building up pretty output

 .outputs.tf.list2list
 .outputs.tf.list2map
 .outputs.tf.map2list
 .outputs.tf.map2map
